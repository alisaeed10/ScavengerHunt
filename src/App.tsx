        The MVP for this project entails setting up OAuth-based authentication
        and authorization for users, creating React front-end interfaces
        (including login pages) for admin and player views, establishing an
        Express server with PostgreSQL databases, and implementing core API
        communication between the views and the server. Integration of external
        APIs like Google Maps and QR scanning APIs will enhance functionality.
        The development of server-side code will accommodate these features and
        ensure seamless operation, serving both admin and player needs.
