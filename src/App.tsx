          This project entails setting up OAuth-based authentication and
          authorization for users, creating React front-end interfaces
          (including login pages) for admin and player views, establishing an
          Express server with PostgreSQL databases, and implementing core API
          communication between the views and the server. Integration of
          external APIs like Google Maps and QR scanning APIs will enhance
          functionality. The development of server-side code will accommodate
          these features and ensure seamless operation, serving both admin and
          player needs.
